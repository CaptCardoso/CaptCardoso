### Projects

- [Ames housing project](https://github.com/CaptCardoso/Ames-Housing-Project): **Linear Regression** Developed a Linear regression model to predict the sale price of houses in Ames, Iowa. I applied Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering to prepare the data for modeling. By utilizing Ridge regularization technique, I was able to develop a model that well outperformed the baseline.

- [Subreddit Classifier](https://github.com/CaptCardoso/Subreddit-Classifier): **Natural Language Processing, Sentiment Analysis** Using the Pushshift API, I gathered 1000 posts from Star Wars and Star Trek subreddits each. I designed a logistic regression model to classify which subreddit a new post belonged to.

- [Afrobeats Music Recommendation System](https://github.com/CaptCardoso/Afrobeats-Recommender-System) – **Clustering, Cosine Similarity, PCA** 
Music recommendation system that recommends an Afrobeats playlist that closely matches any given playlist. Using the Spotify API, I fetched 1500 Afrobeats songs, based on their musical features I used K-means clustering and cosine similarity to group songs with similar features. I built a [Streamlit app](https://share.streamlit.io/captcardoso/afrobeats-recommender-system/streamlit/app.py) for more practical use of the recommender.
